## 🎥 Introduction

**The Shadow Instructor** is a next-generation interview preparation platform that doesn't just simulate an interview—it *shadows* you. By leveraging a unique **Dual-Agent Architecture**, we provide an experience that is both adversarial and supportive:

1.  **The Interviewer (Gemini 3.0 Flash)**: Conducts a high-pressure, realistic technical interview tailored to your resume.
2.  **The Shadow (Gemini 3.0 Pro)**: Silently observes the interaction, analyzing your answers, pacing, and confidence in real-time, providing critical "heads-up" feedback without interrupting the flow.

## 🚀 Gemini 3 Integration

This project was built specifically to showcase the capabilities of the **Gemini 3.0** model family.

### 1. Ultra-Low Latency Conversation (Gemini 3.0 Flash)
We use **Gemini 3.0 Flash** for the `Interviewer Agent` to achieve near-human response times. The model processes the candidate's audio input and generates relevant, context-aware follow-up questions instantly, maintaining the natural rhythm of a stressful interview.

### 2. Complex Reasoning & analysis (Gemini 3.0 Pro)
We use **Gemini 3.0 Pro** for the `Shadow Agent`. This agent runs in parallel, processing the full transcript and metadata. It uses Gemini 3's superior reasoning capabilities to:
- Detect technical inaccuracies in real-time.
- Analyze communication patterns (rambling, hesitation markers).
- Generate a comprehensive, structured "Shadow Report" after the session.

### 3. Multimodal Context
The system ingests **PDF Resumes** and parses them to seed the context for both agents, ensuring every question is relevant to the candidate's actual experience.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎭 Realistic Personas**: Choose your interviewer's style—from "Friendly Recruiter" to "Tough FAANG Engineer".
- **⚡ Real-Time Feedback**: Receive subtle, ephemeral notifications during the interview (e.g., *"Speak faster"*, *"Make eye contact"*).
- **📄 Resume Parsing**: Upload your PDF resume, and the AI will grill you on your specific bullet points.
- **📊 Comprehensive Reports**: Get a detailed breakdown of your performance, including a transcript analysis and actionable tips for improvement.
- **🔒 Secure Architecture**: Built with privacy in mind, using ephemeral tokens and secure WebSocket connections.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a proprietary **Dual-Agent State Machine**:
